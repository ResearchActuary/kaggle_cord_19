# kaggle_cord_19

This repo is a workspace to look at data released by Kaggle as part of their COVID-19 challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge.

There are some short scripts to unzip and do a minor bit of reshaping. After cloning, one will need to create a folder called 'data' and place the file 'CORD-19-research-challenge.zip' into it. This file may be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/download.
